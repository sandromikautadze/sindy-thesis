# SINDy - BSc Thesis

This repository contains the code written for the thesis of my BSc in Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence. The work focuses on analyzing the paper [Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1517384113) by Brunton et al.

**The work is yet to be completed.**

## Files

- ```noise.ipynb``` contains some code and plots used in the work for the Data section 
- ```library.ipynb``` contains some code and plots used in the work for the Library section
- ```sindy.ipynb``` contains the implementation of the SINDy algorithm from scratch. It replicates the identification of Lorenz from the paper
- ```lorenz.ipynb``` continas the application of SINDy on Lorenz using PySINDy. It also replicates other results from the paper.
